# Simple Linear Regression for Sales Prediction using TV Ad Budget

<h2>Description</h2>
This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict sales based on TV advertisement budget. It utilizes Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib. The code is hosted on a Google Colab notebook and the project repository is on GitHub.

<h2>Data Acquisition and Preprocessing</h2>
We've utilized a pre-prepared dataset containing TV ad budget and sales figures.

<h2>Model Training</h2>
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Trains a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn's LinearRegression class.

<h2>Visualization</h2>
Creates scatter plots with seaborn to visualize the relationship between TV ad budget and sales.

<h2>Prediction</h2>
Allows users to predict sales for new TV ad budget values using the trained model.

<h2>Contributing</h2>
